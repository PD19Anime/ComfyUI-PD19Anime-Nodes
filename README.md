# ComfyUI-PD19Anime-Nodes
A suite of nodes for dynamically reading prompts and images.

This node is specifically designed for batch high-resolution image upscaling, saving you a significant amount of time and effort. The original purpose of creating this node was to eliminate the need to manually copy and paste the prompt for each image when processing a large number of files. With this node, you can set up batch operations and free your hands for other tasks, greatly improving your workflow efficiency.

In addition to high-resolution upscaling, this node can be flexibly integrated into your custom ComfyUI workflows to automate a variety of image processing tasks.

This node combines the functionality of the Load Image Batch node from the was-node-suit package and parts of the SD Prompt Reader from the comfyui-prompt-reader-node package. The original MIT licenses have been incorporated into this project's LICENSE file.
